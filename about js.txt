 What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a programming language that is mostly used to control the behavior of web pages. It helps web pages respond to user actions, like clicking buttons, filling forms, or moving the mouse.
Without JavaScript, web pages would just sit there, showing information without reacting to anything. With JavaScript, they become interactive and fun to use.

 Role of JavaScript in Web Development
There are 3 main parts of a webpage:
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – this gives structure to a page (like the text, images, and headings).
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – this adds style (colors, fonts, layout).
3. JavaScript – this adds behavior and interaction.
Together, they create modern websites.

 What Can JavaScript Do?
JavaScript can:
I.	Show or hide content without reloading the page
II.	Validate form inputs (e.g., check if a field is empty)
III. Create image sliders, dropdown menus, or pop-up messages
IV.	Load new data from the internet without refreshing the page (this is called AJAX)
V.	Build full web applications (like online games, calculators, or shopping carts)

 Where Does JavaScript Run?
JavaScript runs directly in the browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge). Every modern browser has a built-in JavaScript engine that understands and executes JavaScript code.
How Does JavaScript Work?
1.	When you open a webpage, your browser loads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2.	The JavaScript tells the browser what to do when certain things happen (like a click).
3.	The browser then follows those instructions and updates the page without needing to reload.
Uses Beyond the Browser
Although JavaScript started as a language for the web, now it's used in many other places:
I.	Mobile apps (using tools like React Native)
II.	Server-side programming (using Node.js)
III. Game development
IV.	Desktop applications

Features of JavaScript
I.	Lightweight – Runs quickly in the browser.
II.	Dynamic – Can change content on the fly.
III. Flexible – Works with HTML and CSS easily.
IV.	Object-oriented – Works with "objects" like buttons, text fields, and more.
V.	Event-driven – Reacts to events like clicks, typing, or hovering.

 Summary
I.	JavaScript is a language that makes websites interactive.
II.	It works inside web browsers.
III. It helps with things like button clicks, form validation, and showing/hiding content.
IV.	It’s one of the most important languages for building websites.
